# Simple WebStore Dependencies
# Core Python packages for the webstore application

# No external dependencies required!
# This application uses only Python standard library:
# - json (built-in)
# - csv (built-in) 
# - pathlib (built-in)
# - abc (built-in)
# - typing (built-in)
# - uuid (built-in)
# - datetime (built-in)

# Optional development dependencies:
# mypy>=1.0.0        # Type checking
# pylint>=2.0.0      # Code linting
# black>=22.0.0      # Code formatting

# The webstore is designed to work with Python 3.7+ standard library only
# This makes it lightweight and easy to deploy without external dependencies
